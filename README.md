# Friends_Recommendation_System
<pre>Friends Recommendation System
A machine learning-powered application designed to suggest potential friends based on user profiles, interests, and social connections. 
This system combines advanced algorithms with a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing users to discover and connect with like-minded individuals. 
  
Key features include:
Machine Learning Module: Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to provide accurate and personalized friend recommendations.
  
Search Functionality: Implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore social connections and identify potential matches efficiently.
  
Interactive GUI: Simplifies interaction with the system, making it accessible to users of all technical levels.
  
User Data Integration: Leverages a dataset (user_profiles.csv) to analyze and personalize suggestions.
  
This project showcases the integration of data science, search algorithms, 
and interface design to create a practical and engaging recommendation system.</pre>
